# Introduction
Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in our daily lives, influencing everything from outdoor activities to transportation planning. One key aspect of weather forecasting is understanding cloud patterns, as they often indicate impending weather conditions. In this project, we aim to segment images related to weather forecasting into two categories: clouds and non-clouds. By utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm, we can automatically identify and categorize regions of an image as either belonging to clouds or other elements.

##  :beginner: About
This project focuses on automating the segmentation of weather forecasting images into meaningful categories, specifically clouds and non-clouds. By employing the K-means clustering technique, the algorithm partitions the image into clusters based on pixel similarities, thereby distinguishing between areas representing clouds and those representing other atmospheric features. The segmentation process facilitates easier analysis of weather patterns and enhances the efficiency of forecasting algorithms.
